# Performance Testing Suite

## Overview
Comprehensive performance tests for the Atoms.tech application covering:
- Page load performance
- Component render performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Bundle size optimization
- Core Web Vitals
- Load testing scenarios

## Test Categories

### 1. Page Load Performance
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)

### 2. Component Performance
- React component render times
- Virtual scrolling performance
- Large dataset handling
- Memory leak detection

### 3. Bundle Analysis
- Bundle size tracking
- Code splitting effectiveness
- Tree shaking optimization
- Unused code detection

### 4. Load Testing
- Concurrent user simulation
- API endpoint stress testing
- Database query performance
- Real-time feature stress testing
